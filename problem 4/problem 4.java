/*
In this challenge, you must read an integer, a double, and a String from stdin, then print the values according to the instructions in the Output Format section below. To make the problem a little easier, a portion of the code is provided for you in the editor.

Note: We recommend completing Java Stdin and Stdout I before attempting this challenge.

Input Format

There are three lines of input:

1-The first line contains an integer.
2-The second line contains a double.
3-The third line contains a String.

Output Format

There are three lines of output:

1-On the first line, print String: followed by the unaltered String read from stdin.
2-On the second line, print Double: followed by the unaltered double read from stdin.
3-On the third line, print Int: followed by the unaltered integer read from stdin.

To make the problem easier, a portion of the code is already provided in the editor.
